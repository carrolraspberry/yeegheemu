Hail to the King Lyrics: Watch your tongue Or have it cut from your head / Save your life by keeping whispers unsaid / Children roam the streets now orphans of war / Bodies hanging in the streets to adore. Lyrics to 'Hail To The King' by Avenged Sevenfold. Watch your tongue or have it cut from your head / Save your life by keeping whispers unsaid / Children. Hail to the King was meant to draw inspiration from the Pantheon of Metal, imitating the sound of such bands as Metallica, Judas Priest, Motley Crüe and Black Sabbath. I like the cimeatic nature of the songs and the fact you feel kinda like a middle ages anti-hero while listening For their sixth studio album, Avenged Sevenfold tempers the typical assault of sharp-edged metal riffs with blues-rock elements that inspired '70s heavies like Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin. 
"Hail to the King" is a song by Avenged Sevenfold and the second single from their sixth studio album of the same name, released on July 15, 2013. The song was premiered live on July 17, 2013, at the Ford Festival Park in Oshkosh, Wisconsin.

I've been listening to A7X's new album, Hail to the King, and I've found it to be utterly disappointing, mostly because the drums are absolutely lame and textbook metal (read: rudimentary) and not even remotely creative. Considering that the Rev was an incredibly talented and creative drummer, with a lot of energy, it was a huge let down. I'm sure the guy is capable of playing drums.

Avenged Sevenfold Album: Like I said I wanted to build a list of songs to learn on guitar and split them up by difficulty level (e.x. beginner, intermediate, and advanced) .

This idea arose because I have had a lot of students who wanted to learn 'modern' metal and I was struggling to find good songs in that genre on the spot. So I would waste time during lessons looking for good songs that would cater to this students needs and would With its 2010 album Nightmare, Avenged Sevenfold focused more on heavy riffs than double-time metallic thrash.
